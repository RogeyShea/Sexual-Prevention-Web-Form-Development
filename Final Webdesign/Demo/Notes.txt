The two files in this folder include: 

Application Form Demo - This inlcudes a video of how to fillout the form via Internet Explorer 
XML File Created - This displays the XML file created from the specific fields filled out in the form

For the form online:
ActiveX controls must be enabled in order for the XML file to be created;
The verification protocol has only been called from the first two fields, Personal Information and Hospital information...
This was done in order to test and demo without constact error messages popping up. Easily can call the validation function...
Within the rest of the Form. Code has comments on how to do this. 

For the XML File:
The XML file is created after someone clicks sumbit on the form. It will then organize each box filled out with the corresponding...
tag. For example LHN is equivelent to local hospital name. LHPN is equivelent to local hospital phone number and so on...
This can then be used on the application side to extract the infromation and easily add it to the app. This is future work to be done.
